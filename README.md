#  Classification Model Tuning Project  

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on **tuning the best model for classification** based on a given dataset. The dataset consists of the following features:  

- **Salary** (Numerical)  
- **Age** (Numerical)  
- **Sex** (Categorical)  

The target variable (**Label**) is:  
- **Purchased** (Binary: `0` - Not Purchased, `1` - Purchased)  

The primary goal is to **research different classification models**, apply **hyperparameter tuning**, and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective approach.  

##  Models Explored  
To achieve the objective, the following classification models will be analyzed:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Na√Øve Bayes**  

Each model will undergo **hyperparameter tuning** to enhance its predictive accuracy and efficiency.  

##  Key Objectives  
 Explore and preprocess the dataset  
 Train different classification models  
 Tune hyperparameters for each model  
 Compare model performance based on key metrics  

##  Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

##  Learning Outcome  
This project serves as a hands-on approach to **reinforcing theoretical knowledge** by practically implementing machine learning techniques, tuning models, and analyzing classification performance.
